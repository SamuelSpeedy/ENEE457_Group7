# Course Project Clarifications 

**Project Proposal:**

- **Report**: Each team must submit a report styled like a research paper, spanning 3-4 pages, detailing their project proposal. This report is due by **October 27th**. Please utilize the [ACM SIG proceedings LaTeX templateLinks to an external site.](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) for your report composition. Emphasize high-quality writing and proper grammar.
- **Practical Deliverable**: A tangible project outcome is highly recommended. Beyond understanding the theoretical concepts, it is our aspiration for you to apply and practice the skills you've learned throughout this course.
- **Content Requirements**: Both the proposal report and presentation must encompass:
  - **Objective**: A lucid definition of the problem or challenge; a justification highlighting the significance of your topic; and the expected outcomes of your project.
  - **Background & Motivation**: An exhaustive review of existing solutions or techniques, and pinpointing the current challenges pertinent to your topic.
  - **Proposed Technique**: Showcase your grasp of security principles, methods, and tools; delve into a technical content analysis; and ensure the relevance and aptness of the methods chosen.
  - **Evaluation Plan**: Describe the dataset you plan to work with, platforms or devices used, the metrics by which you'll evaluate results, and any comparative baselines.

**Proposal Presentation:**

- **Duration**: Each team will be allocated **10 minutes** — a 8-minute presentation followed by a 2-minute Q&A session.
- **Schedule**: **Group 1-7 (Oct. 22)**, **Group 8-13 (Oct 27)**
- **Attendance**: Every team member must be present during the presentation.
- **Structure**: While the presentation's structure can mirror the report outline mentioned above, we strongly suggest adding two more components:
  1. **Timeline**: Detail the progression and milestones of your project.
  2. **Roles & Responsibilities:** Clearly define the specific roles and duties of each team member.

 

Here are examples from previous years—your team is free to choose from these or explore entirely new directions.

- **TrojanCATS:** Built a tool to detect and analyze covert hardware Trojans in digital circuits, demonstrating how malicious modifications can compromise chip security.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Evaluated lattice-based encryption schemes such as NTRU, testing performance and security under quantum-era threats..
- **Phishing Detection with ML:** Developed a machine learning classifier using URL features to detect phishing links with ~90% accuracy while minimizing feature extraction overhead..
- **Password Strength Classification:** Implemented machine learning models to classify password strength per NIST guidelines, with Random Forest achieving the most reliable results..
- **Blockchain Smart Contract Security:** Created a Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker (SCVC) that identifies weaknesses in Ethereum contracts through static analysis.
- **Encrypted Chat & File Transfer:** Designed a lightweight command-line messaging and file-sharing system with AES/RSA encryption, digital signatures, and heartbeat-based connection monitoring.
- **Weak Cryptographic Keys:** Repeated a classic study on random number generator flaws, uncovering thousands of repeated keys in TLS certificates and analyzing risks of weak key generation.
- **USB Logging for Air-Gapped Systems:** Built a USB logging tool with whitelist-based anomaly detection to protect isolated (air-gapped) systems from unauthorized device access.
